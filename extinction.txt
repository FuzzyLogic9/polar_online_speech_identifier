1229778350144516097 2020-02-18 14:43:01 +0000 <Bzubyk> Today‚Äôs budget speech will feature a rally by forestry workers and a threat of blocking the speech/functioning of government by the nutters at extinction rebellion.  Essentially between people who get up to go to work every morning and pay taxes and the freeloaders. #bcpoli
1229615948635811842 2020-02-18 03:57:41 +0000 <SuzakiTheAmazon> Tomorrow in Victoria will mix a loggers support rally and Extinction Rebellion numpties locking down the Legislature.   Life has become so incredibly absurd in this country that I'm not sure if it's real or I'm just dreaming Monty Python scripts. If @JohnCleese shows up üì∏ it.

Earth was doing fine right up until this moment then boom the Bernie rally happened and now it's dying.  You nailed it.  We wouldn't be on the verge of extinction if not for this minor traffic jam in 2020.

1229469831906385920 2020-02-17 18:17:05 +0000 <baylissrally> I‚Äôm planning on organising an Extinction Rebellion Rally.   We can close the roads with impunity and then we can get the rally cars out and do skids until we run out of petrol. No cuts though, as I wouldn‚Äôt want to damage the grass.

The most important issue is, that we have to face OTHER much more important problems such as the Living species extinction, in clouding Sapiens. Do you care?.

Unfortunately, the cause of this is inconclusive. There were no signs of any temperature swings or volcanic activity during this time period #SHRLife  https://t.co/93Widb9Gu6

1229763546159943681 2020-02-18 13:44:11 +0000 <mikjdavies> Extinction rebellion campaigning against fossil fuel investment good thing. Most of these rebellers probably have  pensions which invest in the stock market, most likely fossil fuel companies. So extinction rebellion invest in fossil fuel. Bit of a catch 22. #ExtinctionRebellion
1229763460008943616 2020-02-18 13:43:51 +0000 <chriscartw83> @el_macs A quick step in ..with a question   Updated climate models are warming about +5/+7c of warming when we double the co2 ppm Which means extinction  So, where are the young people ?  Why are so few of you at climate strikes ? Why are so many of you in SUV or planes ?
1229763444192284672 2020-02-18 13:43:47 +0000 <h4wk69> @LBC @ShelaghFogarty Extinction Rebellion will be proud of themselves for getting exactly the reaction they wanted, they want us to say its criminal damage etc because thats what they think we are doing to the planet, their protest is a success imo, even though i dont agree with them on anything.

There are many species in the homo genus that didn't make it, ours learned to adapt our environment for our survival.  As for other species "keeping up" - they are just as evolved but evolved differently to us.
